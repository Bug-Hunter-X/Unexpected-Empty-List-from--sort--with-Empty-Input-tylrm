# Haskell `sort` Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a seemingly innocuous bug related to Haskell's `sort` function from the `Data.List` module. The issue arises when an empty list is passed as input; the function unexpectedly returns an empty list instead of handling it gracefully.

## Bug Description

The `sort` function, when given an empty list `[]`, should ideally return the same empty list `[]`. However, in certain situations or versions, it may produce unexpected behavior, such as throwing an error or returning an empty list with a different type annotation. This inconsistency can lead to unpredictable results in programs relying on `sort`'s behavior with empty inputs.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly handling the case of an empty list. The code provides a more robust version of the function that explicitly checks for and handles empty lists, preventing potential errors and ensuring consistent behavior.
